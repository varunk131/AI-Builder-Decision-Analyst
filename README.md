# AI Builder Decision Analyst

**11 Claude Code skills that catch bad bets before you ship, sharpen every decision, and compound your productivity and ROI over time.**

## What This Is

A set of Claude Code slash commands organized around how product decisions actually flow. Each skill targets a specific decision failure mode. A `CLAUDE.md` file holds your product context, decision history, and known biases so every skill has the full picture.

No app. No API. Markdown files in a folder.

## The 11 Skills Across Four Layers

![All 11 Skills](assets/01-All-11-Skills.png)

### ✅ DECIDE — Before you commit

| # | Command | What It Does |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `/project:assumption-check` | Surface 5 ranked untested assumptions with cheapest validation tests |
| 2 | `/project:downside-case` | Build the strongest possible case for NOT building a feature |
| 3 | `/project:10x-or-10-percent` | Evaluate whether a bet is incremental improvement or transformative change |

### 🛠️ BUILD — Before you ship

| # | Command | What It Does |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 4 | `/project:scope-creep-detector` | Flag every scope-expanding sentence in a PRD or spec |
| 5 | `/project:pre-mortem` | Write a realistic failure post-mortem from 6 months in the future |
| 6 | `/project:strategy-smell-test` | Apply 7 smell tests to detect weak strategy disguised as good strategy |

### 🧠 COMMUNICATE — Before you present

| # | Command | What It Does |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 7 | `/project:stakeholder-translator` | Show how 4 stakeholders will actually read your message |
| 8 | `/project:say-no-script` | Generate 3 pushback scripts for stakeholder requests you need to decline |
| 9 | `/project:exec-summary-sharpener` | Find weak spots in executive-facing documents without rewriting them |

### 🔁 LEARN — After you decide

| # | Command | What It Does |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 10 | `/project:decision-audit` | Analyze your decision journal to reveal patterns, biases, and improvement areas |
| 11 | `/project:portfolio-validation` | Grade your product instincts by analyzing bets you missed or got wrong |

## The Decision Intelligence Report

The LEARN layer is what changed things for me. Log your decisions in the journal, run `/project:decision-audit`, and get a report showing where you optimize for speed when experimentation wins, where you skip structured evaluation, and where your confidence doesn't match your outcomes.

## Setup (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated

### Option 1: Clone and use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-builder-decision-analyst.git
cd ai-builder-decision-analyst

# Run any command
claude "/project:assumption-check We're building a self-serve analytics dashboard for SMB customers"
```

### Option 2: Add to an existing project

```bash
cp -r ai-builder-decision-analyst/.claude/commands/* your-project/.claude/commands/
cp ai-builder-decision-analyst/CLAUDE.md your-project/CLAUDE.md
cp -r ai-builder-decision-analyst/templates/ your-project/templates/
```

### Option 3: User-level commands (available in all projects)

```bash
cp -r ai-builder-decision-analyst/.claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
# Now use /user:assumption-check from any project
```

## How to Use the Decision Journal

1. Open `templates/decision-journal.md`
2. Log each decision using the template format (takes ~2 minutes per entry)
3. After 15-20 entries, run `/project:decision-audit`
4. Review your Decision Intelligence Report
5. Run again in 90 days to track how your patterns shift

The journal captures: what you decided, what you rejected, what you optimized for, who influenced you, your confidence level, and the outcome.

## The Decision Sequence

For major product decisions, run these in order:

```
1. /project:assumption-check       → Find what you don't know
2. /project:downside-case          → Stress-test the idea
3. /project:10x-or-10-percent      → Clarify the bet size
4. /project:scope-creep-detector   → Tighten the spec
5. /project:pre-mortem             → Anticipate failure
6. /project:strategy-smell-test    → Validate the strategy
```

If your idea survives all 6, ship it with confidence.

## How to Get the Most Out of It

**Be specific in your input.** "We're building a dashboard" is weak. "We're building a self-serve analytics dashboard for SMB e-commerce brands who currently export CSV reports weekly and share them in Slack" is strong.

**Disagree with the output.** These skills are designed to push back. If you can refute every argument, your thinking is solid. If you can't refute one — you found a blind spot.

**Log everything.** The LEARN layer gets sharper the more decisions you log. 20 entries is the minimum for meaningful pattern detection.
